# To Run the project by your own
-> Go to the root directory of the project.
-> Type npm i in the terminal of your root folder. (Since node_modules are not included in the file)
-> Run npm start in the terminal of the same root folder.
-> BOOM! here you go your site will be live on /localhost:3000

# To Run the project on deployment 
-> Run npm build in the root folder.
-> It makes a folder named 'build' in the root folder and you can paste the folder to host a live website.
